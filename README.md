# ðŸ§  Day 16: Multivariate Regression with Multiple Outputs (Concrete Properties Prediction)

Today, I explored **multi-output regression** using a real-world datasets. The datasets are of arff format I collected the data and loaded it innto a dataframe using pandas. I realied data cleaning is a very essential part in Machine Learning. A model trained on clean data makes better predictions. I used the IQR method for data cleaning and scaled using MinMaxScaler.


### ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing

- âœ… No missing values detected
- âœ… Outliers removed using IQR method with 10th and 90th quantiles
- âœ… Applied `MinMaxScaler` separately to inputs and outputs
- âœ… Used `.reshape()` to fit input/output shapes properly

### ðŸ“‰ Training Results

- Trained for 400 epochs
- Loss consistently decreased
---

### ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation

- Plotted **Actual vs Predicted** graphs for all 3 outputs
- Graphs show very high alignment to the diagonal (ideal), indicating **strong performance**
- Inverse-transformed predictions to original scale showed **reasonable accuracy** for sample inputs
